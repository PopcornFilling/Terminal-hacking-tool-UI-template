# Terminal-hacking-tool-UI-template

## How are these used?
I dont know the real name of these type of things are called, but I do know you would 
often see them in hacking tools that require you to run and open them in 
terminal, Such as metasploit, setoolkit, and recon-ng etc. 

## So you can have an idea
This is some what of a template. You can use it if you want. But it is to show you
you how the UI of these frameworks work.
