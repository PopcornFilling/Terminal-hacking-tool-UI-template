# Terminal-hacking-tool-UI-template
I dont know the real name of these type of stuff are called, but you would 
often see them hacking tools that require you to run and open them up in 
terminal, Such as Sechub, metasploit, setoolkit, and etc. 

This is some what of a template, to show 
you how its started.
